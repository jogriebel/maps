# Maps
This respository contains code for different maps and visualizations. The data used here is randomly generated and is not the real data. The maps are based on randomly generated data for demonstration purposes. The visualization of the real data can be viewed at https://sites.google.com/site/charlottedsbartels/german-regional-inequality-data-grid.
